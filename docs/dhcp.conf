#default-lease-time = Integer which sets the default lease time in seconds.
#max-lease-time = Integer which sets the maximum lease time, in seconds
#ping = check boolean If true, the server pings an address before assigning a lease on that address to a client.
#option domain-nameâ€“servers = The IP address or addresses of DNS servers the clients may use.
#option domain-name = The name of the domain that will grant fr the clients to use.

#range 192.168.1.50 192.168.1.115 = defines the IP address range that the server will lease IPs.
#option routers = defines the IP address of your gateway or the network exit point.
#option netbios-name-servers = The IP addresses of NetBIOS Name Service (NBNS) servers or Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) servers which are used by SMB/CIFS protocols to share files on Windows.
