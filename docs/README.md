# Setup Pi from desktop

After starting up the Pi, the desktop will open and you should get a *Welcome to Raspberry Pi* screen. If you do execute the following steps, if you don't jump to step 7.  
  
1. You'll see the welcome screen. Click *Next*.

2. Choose your country, language, timezone and if you're using a US keyboard. Click *Next*.

3. Change the default *pi* user password. Click *Next*.

8. Here you can set everyting in step 1 to 6, if you didn't get the welcome screen. If you did continue and set the new hostname and select *To CLI* if you don't want the Pi to always boot to the desktop. You can always start the desktop by running *startx* in the cli.

9. Go to the *Interface* tab and enable SSH. You will probably see a lot more interfaces. These screenshots were made while running Raspberry for desktop, which is a bit different.
